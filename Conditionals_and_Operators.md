## Questions

1. What are the three types of conditional statements?
  if, else, and else if

2. What are the four types of comparison operators and how would you use them?
    1. `==` equality operator. This is used to check if two things are equal to each other. The operator will convert data type so `1 == '1'` would return true. There is also the strict equality operator, `===`. The strict equality operator will not convert data types so `1 === '1'` would return false.
    2. `!=` inequality operator. This is used to check if two things are unequal, basically it will return the opposite of what the equality operator would return. It also converts data types. The strict inequality operator, `!==`, does not convert data types. `4 != '4'` would return false. `4 != '4'` would return true.
    3. `>` greater than operator. This is used to check if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right. `4 > 2` would return true.
    4. `>=` greater than or equal to operator. This is used to check if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the left. `4 >= 4` would return true because they are equal.
    5. `<` less than operator. This is used to check if the value on the left is less than the value on the right. `778 < 1` would return false.
    6. `<=` less than or equal to operator. This is used to check if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right. `7 <= '1'` would return false because 7 is not less than 1 and it is not equal to 1.
