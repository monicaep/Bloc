##Questions

1. What is recursion?

    Recursion is the ability to call a function from within itself. A function calls itself over and over until it arrives at some result.

2. When should a programmer want to write a recursive function instead of an iterative one?

    A programmer would use a recursive function if the problem calls for it. A good time to use a recursive function is when the problem consists of many subproblems, for example the Fibonacci sequence.

3. What is a base case and what is its role in a recursive function?

    A base case is what terminates the function. The function will exit the loop once the base case is true. It is like the condition of a for loop.

4. What would happen if a programmer did not utilize a base case within a recursive function?

    If a programmer did not utilize a base case within a recursive function the function would have no way of terminating, resulting in an infinite loop.
