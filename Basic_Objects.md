1. In your own words, what is a JavaScript object?
    An object is something that holds a group of properties.

2. What is a property of a JavaScript object?
    Properties are associations between keys and values. Keys are like the title or name and values are what is held inside. For example:

    `var student = {
      // properties below
      name: 'Jen',
      age: 25,
      hometown: NY,
      possessions: ['bicycle', 'clothes', 'laptop']
      // properties above
      };`

      In the above object `name` is a key and inside that key is the value 'Jen'.
