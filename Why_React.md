1. In your own words, explain single-page applications and progressive web apps.

    In traditional pages, every user request for new information would result in a new version of the entire page, even if most of the page still looked the same to the user. However, with single page applications, only the requested information gets sent and the rest of the page stays as it was. This makes things faster because instead of having to send and receive an entire page with every user interaction, only the small section that is actually changing needs to be loaded.  

    Progressive web apps give users an app-like experience. They are reliable, fast, and engaging. They work reliably, even if the network conditions aren't good or the user is offline. The interface responds quickly to users and works with any browser and machine (desktop, mobile, tablet).

2. Either from your research or by inspecting popular sites you frequent (using the Chrome DevTools), give some real-world examples of applications built with React and Angular.

    React: Instagram, Airbnb, Angie's List, Bloc, IMDb, Lyft,

    Angular: Eat24, PayPal, Live Nation, Trello, US Bank, Barnes & Noble

3. Write a summary of the benefits of React vs. Angular. Then ask your mentor about the current state of web development, and ask questions about how they use these two popular technologies in their work.

React: React starts off with less features, which means you can have more freedom to customize additional libraries based on your project needs. It uses JSX, which allows you to mix markup and JavaScript and also allows static analysis. This means you can readily catch errors. You can also use Flow to quickly catch errors. Redux is also a popular library you can use with React. It can help you have a clear project structure. Create React App is a CLI that let's you start new projects quickly. You can use React Native to create mobile apps. There is a material design component library called Material UI that has a wider range of components than the Angular library. React is fairly easy to learn, especially if you have experience with JavaScript. The error messages are generally clear, which makes it easy to fix problems.

Angular: Angular comes with more features out of the box, which means you don't have to go sort through a bunch of libraries on your own. You can use TypeScript for static analysis. RxJS helps with the handling of asynchronous code, but is only really helpful for certain projects. Angular CLI lets you set up new projects easily. Ionic 2 is good for building hybrid apps. There is a material component library available. The learning curve for Angular is a bit higher than React. 

The best framework will always depend on your project and team though.
