1. What does "DRY" stand for? What does the "DRY principle" imply in programming or software development?

    DRY stands for Don't Repeat Yourself. It means that every piece of knowledge must have a single representation with in a system. This can be achieved through the use of parent/child or class/subclass relationships where shared code can go in the parent or class and unique code can go in the child or subclass. This implies that simplicity/having easy to read code is important in programming/software development. And also that writing code in a manner that is easy to create and easy to change is important. By following the DRY principle you can save time by not repeating the same code many times and it will also make your code look cleaner and will make changes easier because you can make changes to the parent instead of having to change all of the children.
