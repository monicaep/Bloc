## Exercises

1. Practice breaking it down! Choose one of the following to explain as if the listener has never done it before: What are the steps involved in making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?
  1) Gather your ingredients/tools - peanut butter, jelly, 2 slices of bread, a plate, and a knife.
  2) Using the knife, spread peanut butter on one side of one of the slices of bread. Place the bread on the plate with the peanut butter side facing up.
  3) Spread jelly on one side of the other slice of bread.
  4) Place the jelly slice of bread down on top of the peanut butter slice of bread with the peanut butter and jelly sides facing each other.
  5) Enjoy!

2. In our "Say Hi" example, if the `Say Hi` part of the program never runs, how would you narrow down the cause of the problem? Explain the process and use a roadmap to visualize it.
  User Name Input --> User Button Click --> Say Hi
  To narrow down the cause of the problem I would work my way backwards in the code starting with the code that prints "Hello, !" to the screen. I would make sure that this code is properly executing the printing command and displaying it for the user. If this was all okay I would then look at the code that involves the button. I would make sure that the button is actually a button and that it is properly accepting the user's input when it is clicked. If everything was okay here, I would then look at the code that deals with the user input. I would make sure the code is properly set up to accept input from the user and that the input the user is providing is considered valid input.

3. Create a problem-solving example using a roadmap and the process of elimination for narrowing down issues of your own. You already use this skill daily. Break down and explain a problem you solve in your everyday life.
  Problem: My laptop charger is not charging my laptop.
  Roadmap: Plug charger into wall --> plug charger into laptop --> laptop charges
  Solving the problem: I first checked to see that the charger was in fact plugged into both my laptop and the wall. I then checked to make sure that the socket I was using for my charger was actually working by plugging in a different device. After doing these things I had to determine whether the problem was with the charger or the laptop. I used a different charger with the laptop and it charged the laptop so that meant the issue had to be with the charger. I examined the charger closely, making sure there were no tears/noticeable damage to the cable. Upon closer examination of the charger I found there was small debris in the charger blocking the connection. After cleaning this out everything worked fine.
