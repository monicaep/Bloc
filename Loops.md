## Loops

1. What are the three things you need to provide for a loop? i.e., in `for(a ; b ; c){}`, what are a, b, and c?

    a: initialization (this is where you set the initial condition)
    b: condition (JavaScript will check this condition before each iteration through the loop. As long as the condition evaluates to true, the loop will continue to run.)
    c: final-expression (this runs after each iteration and changes the condition)

2. Describe infinite loops and how to avoid them.

    Infinite loops are loops with no end. The computer will keep running the code forever because there is no stopping point. This can freeze or crash your computer. To avoid them be sure to carefully check your condition and final-expression to make sure there is stopping point to your loop.
